Performance_comparison_of_Global_and_Preferential_crawlers
==========================================================

While working on the crawler4j project for one of my assignments I realized that no performance comparison demonstrations existed for global versus preferential crawlers that were relevant for students. So I registered my own project and made one.

The project heavily borrows from crawler4j (https://code.google.com/p/crawler4j/).

It is intended to be used as a demo for performance comparison between Global and Preferential crawlers and not to be used as a crawler API for java.
